# Rodney Bot

A small helper to automate things with GitHub actions.

For those of you having JavaScript allergies. This one is written in Rust.

**NOTE**: The main purpose of this bot is to help with a few things in the [drogue-cloud](https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud) project.
Therefore, it has only implemented what is required right now. If you need more: open an issue! And of course: PRs are always welcome :)
